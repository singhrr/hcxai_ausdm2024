# Tutorial on Human-Centred Explainable AI: Principles, Guidelines, and Practical Examples

## Abstract
This tutorial on Human-Centred Explainable AI (HCXAI) equips participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop explainable AI systems. Through a human-centred approach, participants will explore core principles such as user understanding, trust calibration, and cognitive engagement. The session covers various explanation methods and offers guidance on designing effective explanations that enhance user understanding and interaction with AI systems. Attendees will gain insights into best practices for conducting user studies and evaluating XAI systems. Through interactive demonstrations and hands-on activities, participants will deepen their practical knowledge. Support materials, including slides, links to XAI tools, and examples of user studies, are provided.

## Objectives
- Understand the core principles and importance of Explainable AI (XAI) and Human-Centred approaches.
- Learn about different explanation types and how to design effective explanations that enhance user understanding and trust.
- Gain insights into techniques that support human-AI collaborative decision-making.
- Learn to design and conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of XAI systems.
